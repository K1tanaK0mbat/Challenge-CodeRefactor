# Challenge 1: Organizing and Refactoring Existing Code - Kitana K
## Description
For our first challenge in the Rutgers Coding Bootcamp, we were tasked with **refactoring existing code** to the business website "Horiseon".
While the given code did work to make a useable website, the grouping of code and the order the code was written was disorganized and hard to follow.
Thus, it was my task to find a better way to logically structure the HTML and simplify the excessive coding for multiple class selectors.
I was able to do this by combining individual classes with duplicate property and values into one single, multiuse class to be used across multiple sections.
I also removed the large amount of <Div> tags and replaced them with proper and relevant structural HTML elements. 
In addition, within the CSS Style Sheet, all the styling code is listed in the order their elements appear.

## Usage  
For this website, clicking on the links next to the title will take you to the boxed sections containing more information on what that service is.
This is an image of the final refactored webpage:

Users can inspect the source code of the linked website and compare it with the code found in the repo to see the improvement.

## Credits
For this assignment, the starter code containing both the HTML file, the images and CSS file can be found in the repo titled: "urban-octo-telegram" by Xandromus.
